  <div class="gradient-border" id="box"> <p style="font-size: 35px; color: aqua; font-weight: bold">About:</p> <br>A web-based Maze solver in which two identical mazes are generated side by side
    in the window. Users need to select two different algorithms for each of the mazes to visualize the path
    chosen by the respective agent. Also, to visualize how the path is discovered by the agent between the start
    and endpoint using the respective search algorithm chosen by the user. <br>
    Mazes would be created in the random fashion each and every time, having said that, obstacles in the
    maze would be chosen randomly. But for the comparison of performance among the various parameters, we
    will take the same random maze side by side. And when the user will choose the search algorithms to run
    on, he can visualize it side by side.</div>
