# AI-Maze-Solver

Points:
1: problem with synchronization since javascript is single threaded event driven programming language it is difficult to asynchronize the methods.
2: generating maze while making sure that there exist a path.
3: user can change maze by flipping maze cell working on it.
4: faced difficulty while creating maze in DOM since html static elements are unaffected with JS DOM. need to work on it and display html elements properly
5: problem with expanding project to more than 1 maze working. It is difficult to synchronize two mazes and run algorithm in parellel.
